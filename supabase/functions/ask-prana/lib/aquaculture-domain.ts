const FISH_WATER_QUALITY = `
Freshwater fish water-quality reference (general warm-water pond guidance; say that suitable ranges vary by species, life stage, culture system and local conditions):
- Dissolved oxygen: aim for about 5 mg/L or more; below about 3 mg/L causes stress and surface gasping, lowest before sunrise. Pangasius (air-breathing) tolerates low DO better than carps; Catla is sensitive.
- pH: roughly 6.5–8.5; wide day–night swings suggest a heavy plankton bloom.
- Temperature: warm-water carps and tilapia grow best around 25–32 °C; feeding drops outside that range.
- Ammonia: the toxic un-ionised form rises with pH and temperature, so interpret total ammonia together with pH/temperature. Main causes: overfeeding, dead algae, sludge.
- Nitrite: freshwater fish are sensitive (brown blood); keep it low.
- Alkalinity and hardness: commonly about 50–200 mg/L as CaCO3; low alkalinity causes unstable pH.
- Transparency (Secchi): about 30–45 cm in fertilised carp ponds indicates good plankton; clearer = poor natural food, much lower = excess bloom/turbidity.
- Salinity: freshwater species; relevant only for inland saline/brackish sites (tilapia tolerates more than carps).
- Tools: aeration, water exchange, reduced feeding, liming, and pond fertilisation where appropriate.
Do NOT apply shrimp limits, salinity targets, minerals (Ca/Mg/K ratios) or shrimp check-tray rules to freshwater fish.`;

const FISH_FEEDING = `
Fish feeding guidance:
- Carps use natural food (plankton/detritus) plus supplementary feed; Tilapia and Pangasius are usually fed formulated pellets.
- Feed as a % of biomass per day, decreasing as fish grow: small fingerlings much higher (often 5–10%), grow-out fish typically about 1–3% for carps/tilapia; use the feed maker's chart when available.
- Split into 2 or more meals; feed at fixed times and places (feed bags/trays for carps, floating pellets let the farmer watch consumption).
- Reduce or stop feeding when DO is low, water is very cold/hot, fish are sick, or feed is left uneaten.
- FCR = total feed given ÷ total weight gained (or harvest biomass − stocked biomass).`;

const FISH_HEALTH = `
Fish health reasoning:
- Consider signs such as surface gasping, abnormal swimming, loss of appetite, skin lesions/ulcers, fin damage, white/cotton growth, parasites (e.g. Argulus), and sudden mortality.
- Check water quality first (DO, ammonia, nitrite, pH, temperature) — most fish mortality starts with water-quality stress.
- Never confirm a disease from symptoms alone; list possible causes and recommend a fisheries officer, aquatic-animal-health lab or veterinarian for confirmation (scrapings, bacteriology, PCR where relevant).
- Do not recommend antibiotics or chemicals blindly or invent doses; follow local regulations and professional advice.
- Shrimp disease names (WSSV, EHP, AHPND, IMNV, white feces, shell disease) do NOT apply to fish.`;

const FISH_CALCULATIONS = `
Fish farming calculations (show the formula and the numbers, state assumptions and units):
- Biomass (kg) = number of fish × average body weight (kg). Example: 10,000 × 0.1 kg = 1,000 kg.
- Survival % = current count ÷ stocked count × 100; mortality % = 100 − survival %.
- Daily feed (kg) = biomass (kg) × feeding rate (% per day) ÷ 100.
- FCR = feed used ÷ weight gain. Growth: ADG = (final − initial weight) ÷ days; SGR % = (ln final − ln initial) ÷ days × 100.
- Stocking density = number stocked ÷ water area (per m², per acre or per hectare as the farmer uses).
- Production/harvest biomass, revenue = harvest kg × price per kg, feed cost = feed kg × price per kg, profit = revenue − total costs. Never invent prices; ask for them.`;
